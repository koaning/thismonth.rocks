Raspberry Pi is a great invention and there's a lovely community.

<br>

All the great resources for getting started can be found on
[the official webpage](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).

If you're interested in sensors you may want to check out the
[pimoroni store](https://shop.pimoroni.com/). They make great
sensors that are plug+play and they tend to have great support
for python. The customer service is great too and they have
inspiring tutorials on their website.

If possible, consider buying gear from a local store.
