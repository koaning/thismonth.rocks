# thismonth.rocks

A collaborative motivational website to encourage you to do something special this month.

## API 

The website exposes the ideas as a json blob. You can see it [here](https://thismonth.rocks/tips.json) or download it via; 

```
wget https://thismonth.rocks/tips.json
```

## How To Contribute A New Idea

If you want to contribute, feel free to add a file to the `src/ideas` folder and add a PR. The icons will be handled by the maintainer and are retreived from [the nounproject](https://thenounproject.com/). 

When submitting an idea, consider these few points; 

- It's the little things that matter.
- We prefer ideas that won't be a burden on a budget. Money is tight for a lot of folks. 
- We prefer ideas that are easy to pick up for most people. It helps if a tip is relevant for a crowd of people. Not a niche. 
- We prefer ideas that are specific. Cooking is great, but it's a large topic. Instead, "perfecting a pizza" would be better. 
- We prefer ideas that make it easier for people to practice social distancing. Content that helps with kids is *much* appreciated. 

This project is also an experiment. Feel free to discuss cool ideas in the issue list as well.

## How To Add an Appendix

If you want to contribute, feel free to update a file in the `src/ideas` folder and add a PR. 

When giving context, consider these few points; 

- Mobile phones have limited screen real estate. Best keep it short.
- It would be great if we can support local businesses who are hit hard by the pandemic. Adding something like "If possible, consider buying the book from a local book-store." goes a long way. 
- Don't overdo it. Just give short meaningful places where folks can find out more when they're inspired. 
- We're here to inspire, not to do marketing or sales pitches. 

## New to Github? 

There's a small tutorial below but we've also made [a video](https://vimeo.com/399993277).

If you're logged into a github account then these are the steps that you need to follow. 

First you need to navigate to `thismonth.rocks/src/ideas`. You should see a screenshot like below. You can create a new file if you want to add a card to the webpage.

But you can also make a change to a card. Say add a desription. In that case ...

And then ...

#### The Editor

Either way, you should now see something of an editor. I've added some text to the document that I saw before.

After you've created the changes you'd like to create you can scroll down and click the green button.

#### It's called a PR (Pull Request)

You should now see a screen that looks like this; 

![](readme-imgs/commit-6.png)

This screen looks intimidating, but for now we'll ignore everything except the green button. After clicking it, we need to click it one more time.

#### We Made a Request! 

You just added a "pull request". This means that the maintainer of the project can now have a look at it and consider if the change is good for the project.

![](readme-imgs/commit-8.png)

The idea is that your change is now "in review" once it is deemed good enough, it will be "merged" into the project. 

You can actually see the pull request [here](https://github.com/koaning/thismonth.rocks/pull/14).
