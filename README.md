# thismonth.rocks

A collaborative motivational website to encourage you to do something special this month.

If you want to contribute, feel free to add a file to the `src/ideas` folder and add a PR. The icons will be handled by the maintainer and are retreived from [the nounproject](https://thenounproject.com/). 

We prefer ideas that won't be a burden on a budget and something that is easy to pick up for most people. It's the little things that matter.

This project is also an experiment. Feel free to discuss cool ideas in the issue list as well.
